# For Giulio

The escalation channel. The mule writes here instead of acting whenever something needs a
**decision** rather than typing: a design choice, a dependency bump, a schema or protocol
change, a contradiction between the code and the frozen spec, a docs page that needs your
voice.

One line each, newest at the top, with the evidence (file:line, tag, CVE) inline. Delete a
line once you have dealt with it — this file is a queue, not a log.

- **The mule's 42 straight failures were ten lint errors in its own base, not a stale branch.**
  `mule/queue` stopped taking `main` on 2026-07-27 and drifted 120 commits behind, which is
  real and is why it is being rebuilt — but it is not what blocked the work. The lint gate runs
  `golangci-lint run ./...` over the whole repo, and the branch's own `internal/flow/*` code
  carried 10 findings (1 goimports, 1 gosec, 8 revive). So every task failed the gate no matter
  how good the change was, including the four tasks queued to fix those very findings: each
  fixed one and died on the other nine. Base tests and `go vet` pass on that checkout, and
  `golangci-lint` and `govulncheck` have been installed on the Pi the whole time — the two
  things that looked broken were not. `main` is lint-clean, so rebuilding from it clears the
  deadlock. `tools/mule.sh preflight` checks the lint baseline and would have said so on day
  one; nobody ran it between 2026-08-31 and 2026-09-04. (Diagnosed 2026-09-04.)

- **Dependency sweep corrected: direct (pinned) deps DO have newer versions** — the 2026-09-02 note said the `go list -m -u` sweep showed "only version-skew on transitive deps", but that run hit the recipe's `head -20` cutoff (all cloud/azure/transitive) and never reached the directly-required modules. Full sweep, 2026-09-04. None of these is a fix this repo *needs*, so no bump is proposed — recorded for the decision. Per module (current → available; breaking change; repo use):
  - `github.com/coder/websocket` v1.8.14 → v1.8.15 — no breaking (patch); used in `internal/appengine/stream/ws.go`, `channels/ws.go`; worth it only for the "transmit in single frame when compression enabled" fix + read-path alloc reduction.
  - `go.etcd.io/bbolt` v1.4.3 → v1.5.0 — bbolt's semver promises no API change between patch/minor, so additive-only; used in `internal/broker/sessionstore.go`; v1.5 adds a data-file size limit and panic-recovery hardening, nothing Astrate needs.
  - `go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/v2` v2.6.0 → v2.8.2 — the 2.8.0 breaking changes are confined to Queryable Encryption string-query options (`options.Text()`→`String()`); Astrate uses only the raw BSON API (`pkg/payload/bson.go`, `internal/engine/capabilities.go`, `bench/`) and is unaffected.
  - `github.com/nats-io/nats.go` v1.52.0 → v1.53.1 — no breaking; the headline fixes (JetStream `resetOrderedConsumer` race, KV dot-rejection) are paths Astrate does not use — `internal/engine/forward/nats.go` is core NATS publish only.
  - `github.com/prometheus/client_golang` v1.23.2 → v1.24.1 — requires Go ≥1.25 (fine, repo is 1.26.1); the breaking `LabelNames`/remote-api renames don't touch repo usage (`prometheus`/`collectors`/`promhttp` in `internal/observability/metrics.go`, flow/engine metrics); would buy `Gather()` panic-recovery and opt-in `CoalesceGather` scrape-pile-up protection.
  - `github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go` v0.43.0 → v0.44.0 (modules/postgres v0.42.0, modules/nats v0.43.0) — breaking in `wait.ForSQL` (callback now takes `network.Port`) and `ImageProvider` (new `PullImageWithPlatform`); Astrate's `internal/testutil/pg.go` looks unaffected but it is test-only anyway.
  - `golang.org/x/crypto` v0.53.0 → v0.56.0 — x/crypto keeps API compatibility; used only for bcrypt in `internal/auth`.
  Note (corrected 2026-09-04): `govulncheck` and `golangci-lint` **are** installed on the Pi (`/root/go/bin`, since 2026-07-28 and 2026-09-01) and `.mule/config` finds them there, so both checks were available; the sweep that produced this list simply ran without invoking govulncheck.

  **Decided 2026-09-04: no bumps.** None of the seven fixes anything this repo has, and each
  one costs a full test run to land. The standing rule instead: re-run this sweep at every
  milestone boundary (the point where `APICompatVersion` or a milestone tag moves), and bump
  only what carries a fix Astrate actually needs. `go.mod` stays on the never-touch list.

---

- **milestone 2.0 looks complete, verify and cut the tag** — all 11 `milestone-2.0` issues
  CLOSED (#23–#27, #37, #39–#43), no open issues, no new gaps after re-checking upstream
  astarte_flow block catalog against `internal/flow/` + git log (MQTT/HTTP source/sink,
  json_path_map, pure-transform set, virtual_device_pool, container block MVP, flow API,
  durable named flows all landed).   (Milestones recipe run, 2026-09-03.)

  **Decided 2026-09-04: the tag is `v0.2.0`, cut on the same day.** The `v2.0`/`v3.0` names
  are milestone names, not release versions — the project is still pre-1.0 and the version
  number keeps its own line rather than jumping two majors to match a milestone label.

---
- ~~`docs/site/appengine-api.md` documents `GET` and `DELETE` on `/appengine/v1/<realm>/groups/<name>`~~
  — **resolved 2026-09-04, and the original note was half wrong.** `GET /groups/{group}` does
  exist (`internal/appengine/http.go:69`); only `DELETE` was absent, and it is absent from
  upstream's own spec too (`docs/api/astarte_appengine_api.yaml` has no `/groups/{group}`
  path at all). So the docs line was spurious, not the code. Line dropped.
---
- ~~`Router.Submit` TOCTOU on the `closed` flag~~ — **fixed 2026-09-04**, and none of the three
  options in the original note was taken: (b) was wrong (a `select` does not save a send on a
  closed channel — it panics either way). The fix is that `Drain` no longer closes the lane
  channels at all; it closes `quit` under a write lock while `Submit` holds the read lock
  across its send, so a lane can never be retired underneath an in-flight sender, and the lanes
  exit on `quit` after draining what is buffered. `TestRouter_SubmitParkedWhenDrainRuns`
  reproduces the old panic deterministically and passes on the fix.
---
- ~~**#87 `lua_map` — needs embedded Lua runtime, parked.**~~ — **closed 2026-09-04.**
  Embedding a Lua VM is not machine-checkable by the mule and Lua flow support is on no active
  roadmap. Reopen in a minute if that changes.
- **#78 FDO device onboarding — milestone-4.0, investigation phase.** Too large for a single
  mule task; the investigation work (reading upstream's TO2 handling, inventorying endpoints,
  schema and keys) is a multi-session project. Parked until the v3.0 queue clears and this
  becomes the next milestone target.
- **#1 is never to be raised again.** Giulio's standing instruction, 2026-09-04: it stays open
  permanently and is not a candidate for closing, triage, or a for-giulio entry. Do not
  propose it again.
---

- ~~**Flow v2.0: named multi-instance flows + pipeline config?**~~ — **decided
  2026-07-29: (b) named multi-instance + config.** Design then implement (#40).
  Doc: `docs/handoff/flow-v2-decisions-2026-07-29.md`.
- ~~**Flow v2.0: durable `flows` table vs in-memory only?**~~ — **decided
  2026-07-29: (b) durable records; `auto_restart` default true, optional never;
  process rehydrates on boot; fail loudly on bad pipeline/start.** Filed #41;
  edge-case follow-ups #42. Same design package as #40.
- ~~**Flow v2.0: containers in scope?**~~ — **decided 2026-07-29: yes, phased
  PoC → MVP (#43).** Native Lua/MQTT blocks are *not* a v2.0 gate (containers cover
  custom logic). Doc: `docs/handoff/flow-v2-decisions-2026-07-29.md`.
- ~~`device_deletion_started`/`device_deletion_finished` trigger events are not emitted~~ —
  **decided 2026-07-27: emit both, back-to-back, around the synchronous delete.** Filed as
  issue #21 (`mule`). (Cross-project survey, 2026-07-27,
  `.mule/research/survey-2026-07-27.md` source 4.)
- ~~Mustache trigger-action templates are accepted but not rendered~~ — **decided
  2026-07-27: implement it.** Guiding principle clarified: Astarte compatibility means
  SDK/wire compatibility, not minimum dependency count — Astrate is allowed to be a
  compatible *superset*. Library picked: `github.com/cbroglie/mustache`. Filed as issue #22
  (`mule`). (Same survey, source 4.)
- ~~`value_change`/`value_change_applied`/`path_created`/`path_removed`/`value_stored` trigger
  types compile but never fire~~ — **resolved: implemented in commit 6bd14a7 (2026-08-22)**,
  and the cost question answered by #20's bench on the Legion Go (2026-08-24 closeout):
  ~0.13 ms keyed read per message, −0.7% throughput even paid once per message over REST.
  Performance is not the constraint for these types (nor, a fortiori, for the group-scoped
  line below). (Same survey, source 4.)
- **Group-scoped triggers (`group_name` on device/data triggers) compile but never match**
  (`internal/engine/triggers/match.go:11-12`). Decision deferred, tied to issue #17
  (group-WATCH-path reconciliation, trickle work, not mule): whatever group-membership
  mechanism comes out of that phase should also report the perf cost for this decision —
  noted in a comment on #17 so it isn't benchmarked twice. (Same survey, source 4.)

---

- ~~The Pi cannot run the race detector~~ — **resolved 2026-07-27** by installing Go 1.26.5
  as a userland toolchain on the Legion Go (`~/.local/go`, no root, `rm -rf` to undo). The
  Pi still cannot run `-race` (39-bit VMA kernel vs the 48 ThreadSanitizer needs), so its
  gate remains `go vet ./... && go test ./...` — but race coverage now exists on the Legion
  Go, where the full suite runs clean in ~40s on 16 cores. The standing `race-check` task is
  the concurrency gate. Concurrency work is queueable again, provided the race-check runs
  after it.
- ~~golangci-lint is not installed on the Pi~~ — **resolved 2026-07-28**: installed v2.12.2
  via `go install` (the prebuilt-binary installer's published sha256 for linux/arm64 did not
  verify, reproducibly, so built from source instead). `mule.service` now sets
  `MULE_LINT_CMD=golangci-lint run ./...` and has `/root/go/bin` on `PATH`; the lint gate
  runs starting with the next tick.
- ~~`/root/astrate` on the Pi has uncommitted work~~ — **resolved 2026-07-27** with the new
  `tools/reconcile.sh`: rescued onto `origin/wip/DietPi-20260727T171543Z` (pushed, not
  reviewed — read the diff before merging anything from it) and `/root/astrate` is now clean
  on `main`. Also had to set `commit.gpgsign false` locally on that clone first — it had
  signing on with no working gpg-agent for a non-interactive session, same class of problem
  `/root/astrate-mule` already solved the same way (your call, confirmed 2026-07-27: align it
  with the existing unattended-Pi-clone convention rather than fix gpg-agent or bypass signing
  silently inside the script).

## 2026-08-23 — FDO promoted to milestone-4.0 candidate (Giulio's decision, recorded)

#78 is no longer parked: zero-touch onboarding is strategic for commercial
viability. Scope frozen on the issue: owner-side TO1/TO2 in our Pairing
service only (last mile, like upstream), reuse fdo-rs for
manufacturing/rendezvous, acceptance = official `astarte-device-fdo-rust`
SDK completes onboarding against Astrate, docs as a first-class deliverable.
When v3.0 is marked DONE, the v4.0 section of `.mule/milestones.md` should be
drafted with this investigation as its first item (issue #78 has the full
verified context).
