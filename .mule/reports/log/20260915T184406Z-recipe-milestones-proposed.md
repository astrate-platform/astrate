Milestone target: **v3.0** (first non-DONE). Scope is decided, so this is a triage/proposal run. Let me gather current state before proposing anything.

State check: v3.0 is the target, its ledger lives under `upstream-parity` (`milestone-3.0` label is empty by design). Last milestone run was 2026-09-13. Let me verify whether anything changed since — upstream releases and the open issues.

milestone-4.0: decide on bumping APICompatVersion from "1.2.2" to "1.3.0-rc.0" (or making it configurable)

Pairing health endpoint divergence: upstream serves GET /pairing/health (no realm), Astrate serves GET /pairing/v1/{realm}/health
CLOSED
2026-09-04T18:34:38Z

State verified identical to the 2026-09-13 milestone run — nothing moved upstream since, no new gaps, no fileable issues. Checking the standing-item (UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL + APICompatVersion) status is unchanged too: both rows and the bump still gate on a stable v1.4.0, which is still rc-only.

Nothing to file and nothing to queue, so the deliverable is one `for-giulio.md` verification entry (the established pattern for these runs).

+- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-15: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-13 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.

 - **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-15: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 10 straight days (#94–#103).** Fourteen open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-13 run: **#103**, the alarm created 2026-09-14 11:27Z ("nothing has landed in 16h"); **#102** has expired into the pile (superseded by #103). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-13 one: close #94–#102** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #103 (live) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
 
 - **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-13: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-12 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated).

Done: v3.0 verified unchanged — no stable v1.4.0 yet, no new gaps, so nothing filed and nothing queued; wrote the standing verification entry to `.mule/for-giulio.md` (the established pattern for these runs, not a "cut the tag" proposal).
