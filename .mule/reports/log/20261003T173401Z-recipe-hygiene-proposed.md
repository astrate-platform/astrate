--- todo.md tail ---
- [x] forward-envelope-bytes-test [auto]: `marshalEnvelope` (internal/engine/forward/envelope.go:19-29) has no direct test — `rg marshalEnvelope` finds exactly two callers (http.go:99, nats.go:45) and no test file — while envelope.go:6-8 makes the strong claim that "every Forwarder implementation in this package must produce byte-identical envelopes for the same inputs". Both suites check the shape only by unmarshalling into `bodyShape` (http_test.go:24-29), which cannot see key order or the exact bytes and would pass unchanged if a field were renamed on both sides. Add internal/engine/forward/envelope_test.go with a table pinning the exact output for (nil, nil) → `{"realm":"r","trigger":"t","action":null,"event":null}`, for the empty-non-nil pair the rule at 16-18 is about, and for a valued pair; container-free, no HTTP server needed.
- [x] webhook-static-headers-override-test [auto]: pin the same precedence rule on the webhook path that forward-static-headers-override-test pinned on the bus forwarder — `attempt` (internal/engine/triggers/actions.go:611-615) sets the fixed `Content-Type` and `Astarte-Realm` and only then applies `a.StaticHeaders`, so an action's `http_static_headers` wins on a colliding name, and the upstream blocklist that gates those names (`blockedHeaderNames`, internal/engine/triggers/validation.go:21-34) blocks `content-length`, `host` and the hop-by-hop set but **not** `content-type` or `astarte-realm`, so both collisions are reachable from a trigger definition. `TestWebhookDelivered` (internal/engine/triggers/actions_test.go:355-400) asserts only the non-colliding `X-Foo` case, so hoisting the static loop above the two fixed `Set` calls leaves the suite green. Add a case with a colliding `content-type` (or `astarte-realm`) asserting the static value arrives at the webhook server; decide deliberately whether upstream parity means "static wins" here as it does in the forwarder, and say so in the test comment.
- [x] docs-sync-ae-forbidden-403 [auto]: add the missing `403` response to every one of the 32 AppEngine operations in docs/api/astarte_appengine_api.yaml — the string `"403"` appears nowhere in the file and `components` defines no `Forbidden` response, yet every route is wrapped by `a.require = mw.RequireRealm(auth.ClaimAppEngine)` (internal/appengine/http.go:35), which answers `403 Forbidden` for a verified a_aea JWT whose grants do not authorize the method+path (`astarteapi.WriteForbidden`, internal/auth/middleware.go:90; `DetailForbidden`, pkg/astarteapi/envelope.go:41; pinned today by internal/appengine/http_test.go:184-185). Add a `Forbidden` response component copied from the realm-management one (docs/api/astarte_realm_management_api.yaml:1277-1285 — `ErrorDetail` schema, example `errors.detail: Forbidden`) and `$ref` it from all 32 operations, which is exactly the parity docs-sync-rm-auth-403 already established for the realm-management spec and that TestRealmManagement403 (internal/swagger/swagger_test.go:123-170) pins; add the same docs-half test for the AppEngine spec. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-ae-patch-by-alias-409 [auto]: add the missing `409` response to `patchDeviceByAlias` in docs/api/astarte_appengine_api.yaml (yaml:241-291, currently 200/400/401/404/422/500) — the handler resolves the alias then calls the same `applyPatch` as the device- and group-scoped PATCH, and a rename to an alias already in use returns `ErrAliasAlreadyInUse` (internal/appengine/service.go:337) which `writeError` maps to `409 ConflictAliasInUse` (internal/appengine/http.go:650-651); the other two PATCH operations already document that response thanks to docs-sync-appengine-query-params-status and docs-sync-appengine-group-patch-status, so this is the last PATCH of the three with a hole. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-ae-add-group-device-422 [auto]: add the missing `422` response to `POST /appengine/v1/{realm}/groups/{group}/devices` in docs/api/astarte_appengine_api.yaml (yaml:939-980, currently 201/400/401/404/409/500) — a well-formed body whose `device_id` does not parse is rejected as a field error (`FieldErrors{"device_id": {"is not a valid device id"}}`, internal/appengine/service.go:631-634) and answered 422 with the `FieldErrorsDetail` body (`astarteapi.WriteFieldErrors`, internal/appengine/http.go:647), so `$ref` the existing `ValidationErrors` response (yaml:1707-1716) rather than `BadRequest` — the documented 400 only covers a body `DecodeData` cannot parse (internal/appengine/http.go:488-491). Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-ae-delete-data-400 [auto]: add the missing `400` response to the three data DELETE operations in docs/api/astarte_appengine_api.yaml (`deleteDataByAlias` yaml:519-547, `deleteData` yaml:756-784, `deleteDataInGroup` yaml:1285-1313 — each currently 204/401/404/405/500) — unsetting a path that matches no endpoint mapping returns `engine.ErrPathNotFound` (`UnsetServerProperty`, internal/engine/serverdata.go:241-244) which `writeError` answers as `400 "Endpoint not found"` (internal/appengine/http.go:679-680), the same 400 the PUT/POST twins already document via `BadRequest`; internal/appengine/writeerror_test.go pins the mapping. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [!] docs-sync-ae-list-devices-422 [auto]: add the missing `422` response to `GET /appengine/v1/{realm}/devices` in docs/api/astarte_appengine_api.yaml (yaml:27-96, currently 200/401/500) — a `from_token` that does not parse as a device id is refused with `ErrValidation: invalid cursor` (internal/appengine/service.go:150-155) which `writeError` maps to 422 with the flat `{"errors":{"detail":"invalid cursor"}}` body, i.e. the `ErrorDetail` shape and not `FieldErrorsDetail`, so `$ref` the same response the group twin uses for the identical parameter (`ValidationErrors`, yaml:934-935) only after fixing its example, or add a dedicated one. Extend the `from_token` parameter description (yaml:44-48) to say the value can 422; do NOT add `limit` to the 422 story, a non-numeric `limit` silently falls back to the default because the `strconv.Atoi` error is discarded (internal/appengine/http.go:87). Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads. — BLOCKED: TIMEOUT after 1200s — task too big, split it
- [x] docs-sync-pairing-error-example-capitalisation [auto]: fix the two wrong error-detail examples in docs/api/astarte_pairing_api.yaml — the `BadRequest` component shows `detail: Bad Request` (yaml:556) and `InternalServerError` shows `detail: Internal Server Error` (yaml:638), but the wire emits the lower-r/lower-s forms the constants freeze: `"Bad request"` (pkg/astarteapi/envelope.go:37, golden fixture pkg/astarteapi/testdata/error_bad_request.json) and `"Internal server error"` (envelope.go:58, testdata/error_internal.json), both measured on upstream 1.2.0 (envelope.go:33-36, 55-57). The other five detail examples on this file (`Not Found`, `Device not found`, `Unauthorized`, `Forbidden`, `Too Many Requests`) are already correct — change only those two. The identical wrong pair is in the other four specs (appengine 1732/1792, housekeeping 362/385/477, realm_management 1265/1348, native 466); leave those for a run of their surface. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads (mkdocs is not installed on the Pi — `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt` first, or at minimum confirm the file still parses as YAML).
- [x] docs-sync-pairing-info-version-example [auto]: fix the `getDeviceInfo` response example in docs/api/astarte_pairing_api.yaml, which shows `version: "0.1.0-test"` (yaml:252) — a value no build can produce. The field is filled from `pairing.Config.Version` (internal/pairing/service.go:302), wired from `main.version` (cmd/astrate/main.go:151), whose default is `"0.1.0-dev"` (main.go:53) and which is otherwise set only via `-ldflags "-X main.version=..."`. Use `"0.1.0-dev"`, matching the four compat-version examples docs-sync-native-version-value already corrected to that (docs/api/astrate_native_api.yaml:203, 223, 243, 263). Do NOT document the service's own fallback `DefaultVersion = "0.1.0-astrate"` (service.go:86-88): it is unreachable from `main`, which always passes a non-empty value. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-pairing-deviceid-base64url [auto]: the pairing spec calls the device identifier "base64-encoded 128-bit" in two places — the `DeviceID` path parameter (docs/api/astarte_pairing_api.yaml:360) and `RegisterRequest.hw_id` (yaml:373) — but `deviceid.Parse` accepts only the 22-character **unpadded base64url** form, in strict mode, and rejects the standard alphabet's `+` and `/` and any `=` padding with an error wrapping `ErrInvalid` (pkg/deviceid/deviceid.go:26, 37, 39-60; upstream parity cited at 36). Measured: with the same `encoding` the parser uses, `dT6hS2W9TT6LEnP25ks+lg` and `.../lg` fail at byte 19 and the padded 23-character form fails at byte 21, so a client generated from the current spec can send a well-formed standard-base64 ID and get 422 `{"errors":{"hw_id":["is not a valid base64 encoded 128 bits id"]}}` (internal/pairing/http.go:307-309). State the exact encoding and the 22-character length in both descriptions and add a `pattern`/`minLength`/`maxLength` to `hw_id`. The existing `hw_id: dT6hS2W9TT6LEnP25ks_lg` example (yaml:123) is valid and stays. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-pairing-initial-payload-format-enum [auto]: constrain `RegisterRequest.initial_payload_format` in docs/api/astarte_pairing_api.yaml (yaml:374-376), an unconstrained string described only as "Optional Astrate extension specifying the device's initial payload format" — so a generated client can send any string, while `Service.Register` accepts only `"bson"` or `"json"` and rejects everything else with 422 `{"errors":{"initial_payload_format":["is invalid"]}}` (internal/pairing/service.go:179-181 -> internal/pairing/http.go:310-312; the allowed set is stated at service.go:173). Add `enum: [bson, json]` plus a note that absent/empty means unset, and add the three missing `ValidationError` examples while you are in the component: `initial_payload_format: ["is invalid"]` (http.go:310-312), `csr: ["can't be blank"]` (http.go:173-177) and `client_crt: ["can't be blank"]` (http.go:253-257) — the component currently shows only the four hw_id/error_name rows (yaml:594-618) and the `csr`/`client_crt` blank-field cases are what a device actually hits. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-pairing-unregister-description [auto]: fix the `unregisterDevice` description in docs/api/astarte_pairing_api.yaml (yaml:153), "Removes a device from the realm. Returns 204 on success.", which reads as a device-and-data deletion. The row and every byte of its stored data survive: `store.UnregisterDevice` only clears the credential trail (`credentials_secret_hash = ''`, `first_credentials_request = NULL`, `cert_serial = NULL`, `cert_aki = NULL`) and flips `status` back to `'registered'` (internal/store/devices.go:93-110), and the service docstring says so outright ("its data is kept", internal/pairing/service.go:227-229). State the real semantics: the device becomes registrable again, its interfaces, datastream data and group memberships are retained, and a second DELETE is a 204 no-op (the row is still there, so RowsAffected is 1, devices.go:106-108) — not the documented 404. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [ ] deviceid-strict-trailing-bits [legion] [auto]: decide whether `deviceid.Parse` rejecting non-canonical trailing bits is a deviation worth recording — `encoding` is `base64.RawURLEncoding.Strict()` (pkg/deviceid/deviceid.go:37), so of the 64 strings that share the 22-character unpadded base64url alphabet and length, only the 16 whose last character is one of `A`, `Q`, `g`, `w` parse: measured, `dT6hS2W9TT6LEnP25ks_lx` is refused with `ErrInvalid` while `..._lA` is accepted, and the pairing spec's `hw_id` pattern `^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{22}$` (added by docs-sync-pairing-deviceid-base64url) deliberately does not encode the rule because a pattern is a client-side contract and upstream's leniency is unmeasured. The docstring justifies strictness as byte-identical round-tripping, which is a reason, not a parity claim, and docs/COMPATIBILITY.md records no entry for it. Measure upstream (Elixir `Base.url_decode64!(padding: false)`, which does not check those bits) on the Legion Go, then either record the divergence in docs/COMPATIBILITY.md or relax `encoding` to `base64.RawURLEncoding` with the canonical-form check moved to `String`.
- [x] fdo-rc6-scope-delta-for-giulio [auto]: upstream v1.4.0-rc.6 (2026-09-30, 27 commits, 154 files, almost all FDO) grows the onboarding surface issue #78 is scoped against, and none of it is in #78's body (written against upstream 1.3 / rc.5): new `POST /pairing/v1/{realm}/fdo/ownership_vouchers/{guid}/to0` re-runs TO0 and returns the refreshed rendezvous expiry (`{"data":{"expiry":…}}`, ownership_voucher.ex:63-73; 409 `device_already_onboarded` via fallback_controller.ex:120-125); voucher deletion, which revokes the rendezvous registration first and *keeps* the voucher if that fails (`:rendezvous_revocation_failed` → 500) and refuses another realm's voucher through `ensure_voucher_in_realm` (ownership_voucher.ex:40-60 — now expressible because the voucher row carries its realm); `device_id` accepted on voucher upload; the device registered immediately on upload rather than mid-TO2 (`add_unconfirmed_credentials`, device.ex:63-85); single-entry x5chain certs accepted; invalid vouchers no longer stored; vouchers and to2-sessions moved from the per-realm keyspace to the global `astarte` one with `fdo_guid` added to the device row (housekeeping/realms/queries.ex:784, 1129-1133); and RM device deletion now cascading to the voucher (device_removal/core.ex). Write the delta into `.mule/for-giulio.md` as a scope update for #78 and say which of these a client could actually observe — do not edit or comment on the issue (GitHub state is read-only for the mule) and do not implement anything.
- [x] compat-note-v1.4-rc.6 [auto]: record in `.mule/for-giulio.md` that v1.4.0-rc.6 is wire-inert for Astrate, as a delta on the open v1.3.2/v1.3.4 wording proposal rather than a re-derivation. Measured, the whole non-FDO delta is inert: DUP RPC-server reliability is OTP supervisor/GC tuning; the Dashboard's new `unknown_status` is computed client-side from `last_connection && !last_disconnection && !isConnected` (models/Device/index.ts:213-215) and both timestamps are already on Astrate's device shape (internal/appengine/service.go:118), so a device whose disconnection was never recorded reads as "Unknown status" rather than "Disconnected"; the `on_device_registered` dispatch moved from `Agent.register_device` to `Engine.register_device` (pairing/engine.ex:157-165, 186-193) so it also covers the FDO path, but the Agent path is byte-for-byte the same rule and Astrate already fires it on every successful registration (internal/pairing/service.go:221-223); the `hw_id` validation moved into `astarte_fdo`'s `LoadRequest` with the error text unchanged ("is not a valid base64 encoded 128 bits id"); and `NonNegativeIntegerOrUnsetType` changed only by a coveralls pragma. So the proposal's "v1.4.0 is still rc.5-only" reference becomes rc.6, and its "FDO authentication (pairing, disabled by default)" line understates the 1.4 line, which ships a full ownership-voucher surface Astrate does not emulate (#78, parked). Do not edit docs/COMPATIBILITY.md and do not restate the standing proposal.

- [x] container-stop-deadline [auto]: make `cliInstance.Stop` (internal/flow/blocks/container/docker.go:167-175) derive its 15s bound whenever the passed context carries **no deadline**, not only when it is nil — both cleanup callers pass `context.Background()` (docker.go:122, the "Best-effort cleanup so we do not leave orphans on mapping failure" path, and block.go:121, the not-ready cleanup in `New`), so a wedged docker daemon leaves an unbounded `docker rm -f` inside `exec.CommandContext` holding flow instantiation, while `Block.Stop` (block.go:310-311) does the same job correctly with an explicit 15s timeout. Measured with the package's own `Run` hook: the `rm` invocation arrives with `ctx.Deadline()` unset on both paths. Add a case asserting `inst.Stop(context.Background())` reaches the injected `Run` with a deadline set (it does not today) and that the hostPort-failure path still issues `rm -f <id>` (docker.go:120-124, never executed by any test today). Container-free.
- [!] container-timeout-bounds [auto]: bound `timeout_ms` and `ready_timeout_ms` in `parseConfig` (internal/flow/blocks/container/block.go:205-219) — both are only checked `> 0` and then multiplied unchecked (`time.Duration(n) * time.Millisecond`), which wraps: measured `ready_timeout_ms: 18446744073709` gives `-551.616µs`, so `New` fails with "container: not ready after wait" without ever issuing a probe (the wrapped negative deadline fails the loop guard at httpbridge.go:64), while `ready_timeout_ms: 9223372036854` gives 2562047h47m16s and `New` never returns (still polling `/healthz` after 3s in the probe). The two consumers of a non-positive duration also disagree — `Bridge.timeout()` (httpbridge.go:39-44) treats it as "use the 5s default" while net/http treats a non-positive `Client.Timeout` as no deadline at all (measured: a client with `Timeout: -551µs` returned err=nil after a 3s handler). Reject a value that would overflow or exceed a documented maximum, naming the key and the value in the error, and add table cases asserting `New` refuses both (it accepts them today). Nothing bounds these on the wire either: internal/flow/blocks/schema.go:19 advertises both as bare `"type":"integer"`. Container-free. — BLOCKED: TIMEOUT after 1201s — task too big, split it
- [x] container-parseconfig-rules-test [auto]: pin the four `parseConfig` rules that no test touches (internal/flow/blocks/container/block.go:188-219 — all `count=0` in `go test -coverprofile`, which is 71.2% for the package): `config` must be a JSON object (192-193), `port` an integer in 1–65535 including the 0 / 65536 / non-integer rejections (197-202), and `timeout_ms` and `ready_timeout_ms` positive (205-210, 215-217) — beside the existing `TestConstructor_RequiresImage` (block_test.go:99), which is the only config case the suite has. The port rule is the one with teeth: it is what keeps `127.0.0.1::99999` out of the `docker run` argv (docker.go:93). Container-free, pure.
- [!] container-response-cap-test [auto]: pin `Bridge.RoundTrip`'s 1 MiB response cap (internal/flow/blocks/container/httpbridge.go:133-140 — `io.LimitReader(resp.Body, maxBody+1)` plus the explicit rejection; lines 136, 138.16 and 138.40 are all uncovered), the only bound between a tenant-supplied container and process memory on the message path: assert a handler answering exactly `maxBody+1` bytes is rejected with the "exceeds" error and that exactly `maxBody` bytes still round-trip, driving a `Bridge{MaxBodyBytes: N}` so the fixture stays small. Also worth one line in the same change: the cap is absent from the operator-facing catalog entry (internal/flow/blocks/info.go:116) and from the schema, so an author whose container emits 2 MiB learns about it only from a runtime error. Container-free. — BLOCKED: lint failed: internal/flow/blocks/container/block_test.go:500:2: redefines-builtin-id: redefinition of the built-in function cap (rev
- [x] docs-sync-rm-error-example-capitalisation [auto]: fix the two wrong error-detail examples in docs/api/astrate_realm_management_api.yaml — the `BadRequest` component shows `detail: Bad Request` (yaml:1265) and `InternalServerError` shows `detail: Internal Server Error` (yaml:1348), but the wire emits the lower-r/lower-s forms the constants freeze: `"Bad request"` (pkg/astarteapi/envelope.go:37) and `"Internal server error"` (envelope.go:58), both pinned by the golden fixtures pkg/astarteapi/testdata/error_bad_request.json and error_internal.json. This is the realm-management half of the pair docs-sync-pairing-error-example-capitalisation fixed there and explicitly deferred with "leave those for a run of their surface". The other five detail examples on this file are already correct — change only those two. The identical wrong pair still sits in the appengine, housekeeping and native specs; leave those for their surfaces. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads (mkdocs is not installed on the Pi — `pip install -r docs/requirements.txt` first, or at minimum confirm the file still parses as YAML).
- [!] docs-sync-rm-legacy-alias-fields [auto]: add the three accepted upstream legacy alias fields to `InterfaceDefinition` and `InterfaceMapping` in docs/api/astarte_realm_management_api.yaml — both declare `additionalProperties: false` (yaml:935, 972) yet omit interface-level `quality` (alias of `ownership`) and `aggregate` (alias of `aggregation`) and mapping-level `path` (alias of `endpoint`), all three of which the parser accepts and canonicalises: decoded into dedicated fields (pkg/interfaceschema/parse.go:116-122, 136-138), normalised before any rule runs (parse.go:212-236), and re-encoded canonically by `ParseInterfaceCanonical` so the store never sees them (parse.go:165-170, 307-311). A spec-conformant client — or any generated client with this schema baked in — therefore rejects a valid upstream-shaped install/update with a spurious 422 while the service would have accepted and stored it as `ownership`/`aggregation`/`endpoint`. Add the three as documented deprecated aliases (enums mirroring ownership/aggregation, `path` a plain string) or relax `additionalProperties`, and record the three rules the code enforces: `ownership` + `quality` is a violation (parse.go:218) and `aggregation` + `aggregate` is a violation (parse.go:227), while `endpoint` + `path` silently keeps `endpoint` (parse.go:307-311). None of the three may appear in a `required` list. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads. — BLOCKED: wrote nothing
- [x] docs-sync-rm-validationerror-example [auto]: fix or split the shared `ValidationError` response component in docs/api/astarte_realm_management_api.yaml (yaml:1330-1338) — it is `$ref`d by exactly three operations, `putAuthConfig` (yaml:574), `createPolicy` (yaml:782) and `deletePolicy` (yaml:839), none of which is an interface surface, so its single example `detail: "invalid interface: missing \"interface_name\""` is wrong twice: the real details are `jwt_public_key_pem can't be blank` (internal/realm/service.go:632-635), `triggers: policy must have at least one error handler` and `triggers: policy name must be 1-128 characters of [a-zA-Z0-9_.~-]` (internal/engine/triggers/policy.go:112-117, wrapped by validatePolicy at internal/realm/policy.go:11-16) and `policy "X" is still used by trigger "Y"` (service.go:568-576) — all rendered by `validationDetail`, which strips the `realm: validation failed: ` prefix from `ErrValidation` (service.go:29, http.go:562-568); and that exact string is not producible at all, because a missing required field returns the bare `missing "interface_name"` (pkg/interfaceschema/parse.go:238-240, no `ErrInvalid` wrap) while the `invalid interface: ` prefix belongs only to the violations renderer (pkg/interfaceschema/violations.go:65-68). OpenAPI here is 3.0.3, so an example next to a `$ref` is ignored — give each of the three operations its own inline 422 with the real detail (the pattern installInterface and updateInterface already use at yaml:138-168 and 274-304), or add one component per surface. Do not touch the two interface ops, whose messages are correct. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-rm-deviceid-param [auto]: constrain the `DeviceID` path parameter in docs/api/astrate_realm_management_api.yaml (yaml:887-893), an unconstrained string described only as "The device hardware ID." — `Service.DeleteDevice` runs the path value through `deviceid.Parse` (internal/realm/service.go:118-121), which accepts exactly 22 characters of unpadded base64url in strict mode and rejects padding, the standard alphabet's `+` and `/`, and non-canonical trailing bits (pkg/deviceid/deviceid.go:24-26, 33-37, 42-60); every rejection is folded into `store.ErrNotFound` (service.go:119-121) and answered `404 {"errors":{"detail":"Device not found"}}` (internal/realm/http.go:107-109), so a client that sends a well-formed standard-base64 or 23-character padded id is told the device does not exist rather than that its id is malformed. State the encoding and the 22-character length and add `pattern`/`minLength`/`maxLength`, exactly as docs-sync-pairing-deviceid-base64url did for the pairing twin. Do NOT encode the strict trailing-bits rule in the pattern: whether it is a deviation worth recording is still open in deviceid-strict-trailing-bits. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [!] docs-sync-rm-update-interface-body [auto]: give the `updateInterface` request body a schema in docs/api/astarte_realm_management_api.yaml — `data` is declared as a bare `type: object` with no properties (yaml:250-261) although the handler parses it with the same `interfaceschema.ParseInterfaceCanonical` as `installInterface` (internal/realm/service.go:196 vs 161) and then checks the body's `interface_name`/`version_major` against the URL's `{name}`/`{major}` (service.go:203-208), so the update body — the one carrying every interface rule — is the only interface body in the spec with nothing to validate against. `$ref` `#/components/schemas/InterfaceDefinition` as `installInterface` does (yaml:115-117), and say in the operation description that the body must name the same interface and major as the URL (disagreement is 409, already documented) and that `version_minor` must increase (409). Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads. — BLOCKED: TIMEOUT after 1201s — task too big, split it
- [ ] container-orphan-boot-cleanup [legion] [auto]: implement the deferred B5 sweep (docs/handoff/flow-design-b-container-block-2026-07-29.md:199, 239) — `CLIRunner.Start` labels every container `astrate.flow=1` / `astrate.realm` / `astrate.flow_name` (internal/flow/blocks/container/block.go:84-93) precisely so they are findable, passes no `--rm` and no restart policy (both explicitly out of PoC scope, handoff §6), and nothing in the tree ever runs `docker ps --filter label=astrate.flow=1` — `rg 'docker (ps|rm|run)'` hits only this package, the example README and the handoff doc — so every astrate crash leaves the previous run's containers up holding loopback-published ports and RAM, forever. Add a best-effort `docker ps` → `docker rm -f` sweep at boot (cmd/astrate/main.go, beside the existing shutdown stages) and prove it on the Legion Go by leaving a labelled container behind, killing astrate mid-flow, restarting, and asserting the orphan is gone while the freshly started one survives. Needs Docker — the Pi has none. If you would rather keep B5 deferred, drop this line; the handoff marks it Optional.
- [x] docs-sync-ae-error-example-capitalisation [auto]: fix the two wrong error-detail examples in docs/api/astarte_appengine_api.yaml — `BadRequest` shows `detail: Bad Request` (yaml:1732) and `InternalServerError` shows `detail: Internal Server Error` (yaml:1792), while the wire emits the frozen lower-r/lower-s constants `"Bad request"` and `"Internal server error"` (pkg/astarteapi/envelope.go:37, 58 via `WriteBadRequest`/`WriteInternalServerError`, golden fixtures pkg/astarteapi/testdata/error_bad_request.json and error_internal.json); every 400/500 on that surface goes through the same astarteapi writers. The other detail examples on the file are already correct — change only those two — and add the docs-half assertion `TestAppEngineErrorDetailExamples` beside TestPairingErrorDetailExamples / TestRealmManagementErrorDetailExamples in internal/swagger/swagger_test.go, which pins the pairing and realm-management halves. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [!] docs-sync-hk-error-example-capitalisation [auto]: fix the three wrong error-detail examples in docs/api/astarte_housekeeping_api.yaml — the `ErrorDetail` schema-level example (yaml:361-362) and the `BadRequest` response (yaml:385) show `detail: Bad Request`, and `InternalServerError` (yaml:477) shows `detail: Internal Server Error`, but the wire emits the frozen lower-r/lower-s constants `"Bad request"` and `"Internal server error"` (pkg/astarteapi/envelope.go:37, 58, via WriteBadRequest/WriteInternalServerError, pinned by pkg/astarteapi/testdata/error_bad_request.json and error_internal.json). While you are in `ErrorDetail`: its `example` sits at the schema level and shows a bare `{detail: ...}` where the envelope the wire sends is `{"errors":{"detail":...}}` — move it under `errors` (or drop it, as the realm-management and pairing `ErrorDetail` schemas carry no example) so a generated client is not shown the wrong shape. Add `TestHousekeepingErrorDetailExamples` beside the pairing and realm-management halves in internal/swagger/swagger_test.go. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads. — BLOCKED: TIMEOUT after 1200s — task too big, split it
- [x] docs-sync-native-error-example-capitalisation [auto]: fix the one wrong error-detail example in docs/api/astrate_native_api.yaml — `InternalServerError` shows `detail: Internal Server Error` (yaml:466) while the wire emits the frozen `"Internal server error"` (pkg/astarteapi/envelope.go:58 via WriteInternalServerError, golden fixture pkg/astarteapi/testdata/error_internal.json); `Unauthorized` (yaml:446) and `Forbidden` (yaml:456) on the same spec are already correct, and this spec has no BadRequest component, so it is a one-line change. Add `TestNativeErrorDetailExamples` beside TestPairingErrorDetailExamples / TestRealmManagementErrorDetailExamples in internal/swagger/swagger_test.go. With that, no spec carries a reconstructed capitalisation any more. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
- [x] docs-sync-hk-error-detail-examples-split [auto]: first tick-sized half of the blocked docs-sync-hk-error-example-capitalisation line, and the only spec still carrying a reconstructed error-detail capitalisation now that the native one is fixed (measured: `detail: Bad Request` at docs/api/astarte_housekeeping_api.yaml:362 and :385, `detail: Internal Server Error` at :477; `detail: Not Found` at :415 is the canonical `astarteapi.DetailNotFound` and is already correct). Fix only the two responses — `BadRequest` to `detail: Bad request` and `InternalServerError` to `detail: Internal server error` (pkg/astarteapi/envelope.go:37, 58) — and add `TestHousekeepingErrorDetailExamples` beside `TestNativeErrorDetailExamples` in internal/swagger/swagger_test.go, pinning those two plus the already-correct `Unauthorized`/`Forbidden`/`NotFound`/`DeviceNotFound` responses. Leave the `ErrorDetail` schema-level example (yaml:361-362, a bare `{detail: ...}` sitting under `errors:` where the wire sends `{"errors":{"detail":...}}`) to a second line: that shape half is what made the original line too big. Run `make -C docs build` and confirm the Swagger-referenced YAML still loads.
