#93 In internal/broker/aclhook.go the control/keyAgreement deny comment (lines ~66-69) quotes an upstream doc sentence that upstream deleted in d084308 on 2026-08-31 — rewrite the comment so it justifies the deny as Astrate's own deliberate choice (upstream now publishes a full wire spec in 082-key_agreement_protocol.md and states the handshake IS implemented on the Astarte side; scope decision tracked in issue #92), cite 082 instead of the deleted 080 sentence, keep the deny behaviour and aclhook_test.go:53 unchanged [mule-review upstream-parity ] [map[author:map[login:atsetilam] authorAssociation:MEMBER body:The mule pushed `8c61268` to `mule/queue` for this.

Unreviewed: the gates passed — it compiles, the tests pass, a new test was shown to fail without the change, and no frozen file was touched. That is not the same as the change being worth having. Nothing merges to `main` until someone reads it:

Left open on purpose.

#92 keyAgreement: upstream published the full wire spec (082) — decide whether the parking from #51 still holds [enhancement upstream-parity upstream-experimental ] [map[author:map[login:atsetilam] authorAssociation:MEMBER body:Parked by Giulio on 2026-09-04: **wait for a stable \`v1.4.0\`.** The spec is complete but ships only in \`v1.4.0-rc.5\`, and building against an rc risks rebuilding it.

So this issue is not waiting on anyone to remember it. It has a row in [`.mule/waiting-on.md`](https://github.com/astrate-platform/astrate/blob/main/.mule/waiting-on.md), and the weekly `mule-upstream-watch` job now reads that file as its first step every run: when a stable `v1.4.0` tag exists upstream, it escalates to `.mule/for-giulio.md` naming this issue. An `-rc.N` does not satisfy the row.

That mechanism was added because it was missing here: #51 was parked on the same condition, the condition fired on 2026-08-31, and nothing connected the new upstream tags to the parked issue — it took a hand triage four days later to catch it. createdAt:2026-09-04T19:52:21Z id:IC_kwDORmfsJs8AAAABSo0f8A includesCreatedEdit:false isMinimized:false minimizedReason: reactionGroups:[] url:https://github.com/astrate-platform/astrate/issues/92#issuecomment-5545730032 viewerDidAuthor:true]]c
#78 FDO device onboarding: owner-side TO1/TO2 in Pairing (milestone-4.0 candidate) [enhancement milestone-4.0 upstream-parity ] [map[author:map[login:atsetilam] authorAssociation:MEMBER body:Reframed 2026-08-23 by Giulio's decision: no longer parked — **strategic feature** (zero-touch factory onboarding is a commercial-viability requirement for an IoT platform), milestone-4.0 candidate.

## Verified facts (2026-08-23, upstream master)

- Upstream integrates FDO **inside the Pairing service**: `fdo_onboarding_controller.ex`, session plugs (`setup_fdo`, `fdo_session`), CBOR codec + voucher queries in `astarte_data_access`, and two dedicated libs `astarte_fdo` / `astarte_fdo_core` (SECO Mind, 2025; bugfixes through 2026-05). Not an optional sidecar.
- Device side is the official SDK `astarte-device-fdo-rust` (crate on docs.rs, pushed 2026-08-21) — actively maintained.
- Upstream does NOT implement manufacturing / rendezvous services either; those come from the FIDO Alliance reference stack (`fdo-rs/fido-device-onboard-rs`, used by Red Hat/Fedora IoT).

## Scope decision

Astrate implements **only the last mile**, mirroring upstream's cut:
- owner-side protocol surface in our pairing service (TO1 redirect + TO2 onboarding, CBOR wire format, ownership-voucher storage, owner key management)
- reuse the existing open-source FDO ecosystem for manufacturing/rendezvous — never reimplement it.

**Acceptance:** a device running the official `astarte-device-fdo-rust` SDK completes onboarding against Astrate end-to-end and lands as a provisioned realm device.

**Docs are a first-class deliverable:** upstream ships almost no public FDO documentation (code-level only); ours must exceed that — operator guide covering the full chain (manufacturing → rendezvous → owner) with Astrate-specific setup.

## Next step

Investigation phase before any implementation: read upstream's TO2 handling end-to-end (`libs/astarte_fdo*", pairing controllers/plugs, `fdo/queries`), inventory the exact endpoints, credential/voucher schema and key material required, and measure what our pairing service lacks. Output feeds the v4.0 scope decision in `.mule/milestones.md`. createdAt:2026-08-23T16:16:08Z id:IC_kwDORmfsJs8AAAABQRcugw includesCreatedEdit:false isMinimized:false minimizedReason: reactionGroups:[] url:https://github.com/astrate-platform/astrate/issues/78#issuecomment-5387005571 viewerDidAuthor:true]]c

.mule/for-giulio.md:13:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-13: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-12 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
.mule/for-giulio.md:15:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-13: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 9 straight days (#94–#102).** Thirteen open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-12 run: **#102**, today's alarm (created 11:09Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#101** has expired into the pile (superseded by #102). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-12 one: close #94–#101** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #102 (live today) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
.mule/for-giulio.md:17:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-12: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) again shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing since the 2026-09-11 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked per Giulio 2026-09-04 on stable v1.4.0), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review; `8c61268` on `mule/queue`, **not yet on `origin/main`**), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled.

.mule/for-giulio.md:21:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-12: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 8 straight days (#94–#101).** Twelve open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-11 run: **#101**, today's alarm (created 10:58Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#100** has expired into the pile (superseded by #101). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-11 one: close #94–#100** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #101 (live today) to self-expire.

.mule/for-giulio.md:23:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-11: nothing new proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 7 straight days and worth a look.** Twelve open issues. Still no machine-checkable fix candidates, so no task lines: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-10 run: **#100**, today's alarm (created 10:55Z, "nothing has landed in 15h"). #99–#94 are the same `mule-alarm` (one per day 2026-09-05→09-10, ~11:00Z each, zero comments) — telemetry, not code issues, so never proposable. But seven consecutive alarms is past the "low-activity window" wording earlier runs used: the mule has landed no commit since ~2026-09-04/05, and `main`'s queue copy shows the top line as `- [ ]` while the landed work below is all `[!] BLOCKED` (`wrote nothing` / `tests failed`) — though `mule/queue` is the authoritative copy. **Proposal: close #94–#99** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #100 (live today) to self-expire. If the idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.

Wire-relevant v1.3.0 deltas (release notes): **MQTT v1 capabilities** incl. `purge_properties_compression_format` (plaintext vs zlib purge — touches the `emptyCache`/`producer,properties` contract COMPATIBILITY.md deviation 1 documents); **empty introspection now allowed**; **device registration triggers** (pairing) and **device deletion started/completed triggers** (RM — the latter two already exist as Astrate deviation 9 emits both around the synchronous delete); **FDO authentication** (pairing, disabled by default); **realm-scoped health** — upstream v1.3 added `GET /pairing/v1/{realm}/health`, which Astrate already serves (`internal/pairing/http.go:78-81`, comment already says "upstream 1.3+"), so deviation 18's wording ("which upstream 404s") is now false against 1.3 and the note should be reworded either way. Proposed doc wording (for your approval, edit to taste): in §Infrastructure differences add a sentence — *"Compatibility target: upstream **v1.2.2** (`GET /v1/{realm}/version` reports `1.2.2`). Upstream v1.3.x capabilities (MQTT v1 capabilities incl.
.mule/for-giulio.md:144:plaintext `purge_properties_compression_format`, empty-introspection allowance, device registration/deletion triggers, experimental FDO pairing auth) are not yet emulated and are out of scope until the milestone that adopts v1.3.2 as the target."* — and reword deviation 18's realm-health note from "which upstream 404s" to "added by upstream v1.3 (Astrate serves it against a 1.2.2 target; kept, matching behavior)". Raw upstream changes: [v1.3.0](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte/releases/tag/v1.3.0), [v1.3.2](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte/releases/tag/v1.3.2).

Fold into the existing v1.3.x wording proposal already in for-giulio.md rather than re-deriving it. — BLOCKED: wrote nothing

Now let me triage. Let me check what task lines already exist for these issues and look at the current for-giulio/alarm context.
$ test -f .mule/waiting-on.md && rg -n -i "92|keyAgreement|v1.4.0" .mule/waiting-on.md || echo "no waiting-on.md"
no waiting-on.md

Same pattern as every run since Sept 9. All open issues are either:
- **#94–#103**: mule-alarm duplicates (idle queue telemetry, not code bugs)
- **#93**: already pushed `8c61268` to `mule/queue`, on its own mule-review path
- **#92**: parked on stable v1.4.0, tracked in waiting-on.md and escalated
- **#78**: milestone-4.0, already escalated to for-giulio.md
- **#1**: wontfix, standing instruction to never touch

No new machine-checkable code-fix candidates. Nothing to propose for todo.md. I'll write the triage report to for-giulio.md and extend the stale-alarm close proposal.
→ Read .mule/for-giulio.md [limit=30]
Let me check #103's creation time to write an accurate entry, following the established for-giulio.md pattern.

$ gh issue view 103 --json number,title,createdAt,labels --template '{{.number}} | {{.title}} | {{.createdAt}} | [{{range .labels}}{{.name}} {{end}}]'
103 | mule: nothing has landed in 16h | 2026-09-14T11:27:08Z | [mule-alarm ]

Same pattern as every run since Sept 9: nothing new and proposable. All open issues are accounted for — #93 (mule-review, commit `8c61268` pushed), #92 (parked on v1.4.0), #78 (escalated milestone-4.0), #1 (never touch), and #94–#103 mule-alarms (idle-queue telemetry). No machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. I'll extend the stale-alarm close proposal per the recipe.

The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.

 - **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-13: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-12 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
 
 - **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-13: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 9 straight days (#94–#102).** Thirteen open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-12 run: **#102**, today's alarm (created 11:09Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#101** has expired into the pile (superseded by #102). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-12 one: close #94–#101** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #102 (live today) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
 

Recipe carried out. All 14 open issues triaged; nothing new is proposable as a todo.md task (no machine-checkable fix candidates — same set as every run since Sept 9), so the deliverable is the for-giulio.md escalation line extending the stale-alarm close proposal.

Done: triaged github-issues; no new task lines possible; extended stale mule-alarm close proposal #94–#102 to for-giulio.md (#103 live, left to self-expire)
Files: .mule/for-giulio.md
Verified: gh issue list --state open --limit 40 -> pass (14 open, same set); gh issue view 103 -> pass
Unsure: nothing
Follow-ups: none (no machine-checkable fix candidates among open issues — #93 pushed `8c61268` on mule-review path, #92 parked on v1.4.0, #78 already escalated, #1 never touched, #94–#103 are idle-queue alarms)
