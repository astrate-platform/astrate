# Todos
[•] Read .mule/research/upstream-parity-2026-08-22.md to understand #47-#89 backlog
[ ] Check gh issue list for milestone-v3.0 / upstream-parity labels to avoid duplication
[ ] Reconcile docs/UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL.md standing item
[ ] Triage #47-#89 into audits/features/decisions; write for-giulio + todo lines; maybe file sub-issues
[ ] Append deliverables (.mule/todo.md lines, possibly gh issue create, for-giulio entry)

Milestone v3.0 (first not-DONE section) is the target. Let me investigate.

fd9f5d0 mule: log swagger-sub-failfast
1d321ea mule: swagger-sub-failfast [auto]: make `Mount` fail fast (panic) when `fs.Sub` over the `docs.SwaggerUI`/`docs.APIYAML` embeds errors — `uiRoot, _ := fs.Sub(...)` and `apiRoot, _ := fs.Sub(...)` (internal/swagger/swagger.go:17-18) silently serve an empty tree → 404s at /swagger/ and /api/ with no log the day the docs embed layout changes; add an fs-injecting internal variant (`MountWithFS(mux, uiRoot, apiRoot fs.FS)` called by `Mount` after the subs) so a broken-FS unit test in swagger_test.go can prove the fail-fast, keeping the public `Mount(mux)` signature and its single main.go:414 caller untouched. Container-free.

The named reference doc `.mule/research/upstream-parity-2026-08-22.md` is missing from every branch. But the milestone also names the live backlog issues #47–#89, which are reachable. Let me gather the actual state before deciding.

$ cd /root/astrate-mule && for n in 92 93 78 90 51; do echo "========== ISSUE #$n =========="; gh issue view $n --json number,title,state,labels,body 2>&1 | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print('#%s [%s] %s' % (d['number'], d['state'], d['title'])); print('labels:', ', '.join(l['name'] for l in d['labels'])); print('---body---'); print(d['body'][:1500])"; done
========== ISSUE #92 ==========
#92 [OPEN] keyAgreement: upstream published the full wire spec (082) — decide whether the parking from #51 still holds
labels: enhancement, upstream-parity, upstream-experimental
---body---
Issue #51 was closed on 2026-08-22 with: *"Full keyAgreement/encrypted-mappings support stays parked until the upstream 1.4 experimental spec stabilizes — reopen or file fresh when it does."* Filing fresh: that condition has now partly fired.

**What changed.** Upstream commit `d084308` ("docs: add encrypted endpoints key agreement (#2067)", 2026-08-31) added `doc/pages/architecture/082-key_agreement_protocol.md` — a 267-line full wire protocol — and rewrote the Key Agreement section of `080-mqtt-v1-protocol.md`.

**Verified against upstream `master` today, not taken from the survey:**

- `082-key_agreement_protocol.md` exists and is 13,832 bytes.
- The sentences the old parking rested on — "reserved and routed correctly, but the handshake protocol is not yet implemented" and "accepted and acknowledged by Astarte, but no response is sent until the feature is fully implemented" — are **gone from both 080 and 082** (grep count 0 in each).
- 082 now states the handshake "is implemented on the Astarte side (`astarte_data_updater_plant`)", with only device-side session-key usage still described as liable to evolve.

**What the spec now pins down**, where before there was only a sketch: five QoS-2 topics `control/keyAgreement/0..4` (InitExchange, ExchangeResp, SecretHash, HashOk, ExchangeFailed — the 080 table moved from a single `control/keyAgreement` at QoS 1); CBOR message bodies with CDDL given; `alg` 0 = `ECDH_P256-HKDF_SHA256-AES_256_GCM`; a CBOR-wrapped COSE_Key pubkey plus 
========== ISSUE #93 ==========
#93 [OPEN] In internal/broker/aclhook.go the control/keyAgreement deny comment (lines ~66-69) quotes an upstream doc sentence that upstream deleted in d084308 on 2026-08-31 — rewrite the comment so it justifies the deny as Astrate's own deliberate choice (upstream now publishes a full wire spec in 082-key_agreement_protocol.md and states the handshake IS implemented on the Astarte side; scope decision tracked in issue #92), cite 082 instead of the deleted 080 sentence, keep the deny behaviour and aclhook_test.go:53 unchanged
labels: mule-review, upstream-parity
---body---
Comment-only change. The deny itself stays; only its stated justification is stale.

`internal/broker/aclhook.go` currently reads:

```go
// control/keyAgreement (080-mqtt-v1-protocol.md:172-176) is deliberately
// unsupported: upstream itself documents the handshake as "reserved and
// routed correctly, but not yet implemented", so falling through to the
// deny path below matches upstream's own status rather than being a gap.
```

That reasoning no longer holds on either half. Verified against upstream `master`:

- The quoted sentence, and the companion "accepted and acknowledged by Astarte, but no response is sent until the feature is fully implemented", are **gone from both** `080-mqtt-v1-protocol.md` and the new `082-key_agreement_protocol.md` (grep count 0 in each).
- `082-key_agreement_protocol.md` (13,832 bytes, added by upstream `d084308` on 2026-08-31) states the handshake "is implemented on the Astarte side (`astarte_data_updater_plant`)".
- The 080 topic table row also changed shape: a single `control/keyAgreement` at QoS 1 became `control/keyAgreement/<message id>` at QoS 2.

So the comment now tells a reader something false about upstream, and a future reader could reasonably "fix the gap" on the strength of it.

**Do:** rewrite the comment so it stands on Astrate's own decision — the topic is denied because full key agreement is out of scope for the current 1.2.2 target and the spec ships only in `v1.4.0-rc.5` (`v1.3.3` is the newest stable tag) — cite `082-key
========== ISSUE #78 ==========
#78 [OPEN] FDO device onboarding: owner-side TO1/TO2 in Pairing (milestone-4.0 candidate)
labels: enhancement, milestone-4.0, upstream-parity
---body---
Upstream 1.3 experimental, default-on in 1.4: TO2 CBOR endpoints under `/v1/{realm}/fdo/101/msg/{60..70}` (auto-registers the device mid-flow, hands over credentials_secret), owner side `POST/GET .../fdo/owner_keys` + ownership vouchers with TO0 claim, secrets in Vault/OpenBao, rendezvous server required.

Large surface; needs a product call (who runs a rendezvous server?) before any implementation. Parked.
Size L.\n\n---\nInvestigation: `.mule/research/upstream-parity-2026-08-22.md` (upstream v1.3.3 / v1.4.0-rc.5 vs Astrate target 1.2.2).
========== ISSUE #90 ==========
#90 [CLOSED] milestone-4.0: decide on bumping APICompatVersion from "1.2.2" to "1.3.0-rc.0" (or making it configurable)
labels: enhancement, milestone-4.0
---body---
Reminder of a pending decision parked during the upstream-parity investigation (#47–#89). **Do not raise the version now** — this is a milestone-4.0 item.

## Context

`realm.APICompatVersion` (`internal/realm/service.go`) is currently hardcoded to `"1.2.2"` — the emulated upstream API level Astrate declares.

Edgehog 0.13.1 gates just-in-time provisioning triggers (`device_registered`, `device_deletion_started`) behind a Realm Management version >= 1.3. Astrate's engine already supports those trigger kinds end-to-end — verified in #28 (Edgehog compatibility investigation) — but Edgehog refuses to use them because of the declared version string.

## What this issue must cover when picked up

1. **Audit first**: what else does declaring "1.3" imply for other consumers?
   - `astarte-dashboard` is currently validated against 1.2.2 behavior (see #13, error-name bundle comparison). Check whether any dashboard code path feature-gates on RM version besides the policies UI gate (>= 1.1.1).
   - Sweep the parity findings (#47–#89): several are "1.3/1.4 features" we deliberately do NOT implement yet — does declaring 1.3 overpromise any of them?
   - Check device SDKs and `astartectl` for version-gated behavior.
2. **Then decide one of**:
   - bump the constant to `"1.3.0-rc.0"` (upstream's own pre-release numbering for that line);
   - or make it configuration (`internal/config`) so operators can declare the level their consumers expect.
3. Update `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` deviation #10

#51 [CLOSED] keyAgreement control topic + encrypted mappings (upstream 1.4 experimental) — investigate/park
labels: enhancement, upstream-parity
---body---
Upstream master reserves `<realm>/<dev>/control/keyAgreement` (QoS 1, CBOR) with a COSE handshake negotiating a DEK for mappings marked `encrypted: true`; AppEngine encrypts server→device values too. Docs lag the code — unstable/experimental spec.

Minimum obligation now: tolerate unknown control paths gracefully (upstream acks them). Full support parked pending upstream stabilization.
Size L if ever implemented.\n\n---\nInvestigation: `.mule/research/upstream-parity-2026-08-22.md` (upstream v1.3.3 / v1.4.0-rc.5 vs Astrate target 1.2.2).

The named reference `.mule/research/upstream-parity-2026-08-22.md` is missing from this checkout. Let me search all branches and git objects thoroughly before concluding it's unreachable.

13:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-24: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 17 days (#94–#110).** Twenty-one open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, `8c61268` already pushed, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on a stable upstream v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-20 runs: the alarms **#108** (09-21), **#109** (09-22) and **#110** (today, 09-24 10:54Z, the live one) — a four-day gap on 09-23 not withstanding. Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so **no .mule/todo.md task lines added**. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-20 one: close #94–#109** — each was a one-day event, superseded by the next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #110 (live today) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
17:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-23: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable remains `v1.3.4` (2026-09-18, maintenance-only, no wire/API surface change), newest overall remains `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-21 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated); the #47–#89 rest are all closed. Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
21:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-23: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 16 alarms (#94–#109).** Twenty open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-21 run: **#109**, yesterday's alarm (created 09-22 10:54Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#108** has expired into the pile (superseded by #109). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-21 one: close #94–#108** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #109 (live) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — now a ~17-day idle streak — if that is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
29:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-21: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 16 days (#94–#108).** Eighteen open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-20 evening run: **#108**, today's alarm (created 09-21 10:54Z, "nothing has landed in 15h"); **#107** has expired into the pile (superseded by #108). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-20 one: close #94–#107** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #108 (live today) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
33:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-21: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable remains `v1.3.4` (2026-09-18, maintenance-only, no wire/API surface change), newest overall remains `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-20 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated); the #47–#89 rest are all closed. Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled.

Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
37:- **github-issues triage re-run, 2026-09-20 (evening): nothing proposable, no change since this morning's 13:10 run.** Re-surveyed with the recipe command: the issue set is identical to the 2026-09-20 morning triage — **#94–#107** are still the daily `mule-alarm` noise (14 issues, zero comments, telemetry not code), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite is still mule-review with `8c61268` already pushed (its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement is still parked on a stable upstream v1.4.0 with its waiting-on.md row and the mule-upstream-watch escalation wired (an -rc does not satisfy it), **#78** FDO is still the milestone-4.0 design/investigation already escalated, and **#1** is untouched per standing instruction. No new issue has been filed since the morning run. Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so **no .mule/todo.md task lines proposed**. This morning's proposal stands unchanged: **close #94–#106** — each was a one-day event, superseded by the next day's alarm, never actionable — and leave **#107** (still the newest, no #108 yet) to self-expire. The queue idle streak since ~2026-09-04/05 persists; if that is not intentional the wedge is on the Pi (queue review = the fix, per the 13:10 line).
41:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-20: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable remains `v1.3.4` (2026-09-18, maintenance-only, no wire/API surface change), newest overall remains `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-19 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated); the #47–#89 rest are all closed.

49:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-20: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 15 days (#94–#107).** Seventeen open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-18 run: **#107**, yesterday's alarm (created 09-19 10:49Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#106** has expired into the pile (superseded by #107).

Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
57:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-18 (second, same day): v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable is today's `v1.3.4` (2026-09-18, maintenance-only — data_updater_plant GC-sweep + RPC-availability fixes, no wire/API surface change, no new gap), newest overall remains `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20). `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated).

Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
65:- **COMPATIBILITY.md wording update for upstream v1.3.4 (newest stable, 2026-09-18; v1.4.0 is still rc.5-only) — folds v1.3.3 and v1.3.4 into the open v1.3.2 proposal below; both are maintenance-only and wire-inert, so that proposal stands unchanged.** v1.3.3 (2026-08-07) was an empty-body patch and v1.3.4 (2026-09-18, `astarte_data_updater_plant` only — more frequent fullsweep GC on AMQPDataConsumer processes plus an RPC-availability fix; release body via `gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases` `v1.3.4`) introduce **no wire/API surface change**, so the v1.3.2 wording proposal stands complete: same decision (adopt the 1.3 line, then doc + `APICompatVersion` bump together per the bump rule, or keep 1.2.2 and add the "not yet emulated" note), same "not yet emulated" list, same deviation 18 reword ("added by upstream v1.3"). The only delta a v1.3.4-aware doc carries is the version reference: the proposed §Infrastructure-differences sentence's "until the milestone that adopts v1.3.2 as the target" reads "until the milestone that adopts the v1.3 line (**newest stable v1.3.4**) as the target". Raw: [v1.3.4](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte/releases/tag/v1.3.4).

New since the 2026-09-17 run: **#106**, today's alarm (created 09-18 10:54Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#105** has expired into the pile (superseded by #106). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-17 one: close #94–#105** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #106 (live today) to self-expire.

New since the 2026-09-13 run: **#103**, the alarm created 2026-09-14 11:27Z ("nothing has landed in 16h"); **#102** has expired into the pile (superseded by #103). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-13 one: close #94–#102** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #103 (live) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
89:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-13: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-12 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
91:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-13: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 9 straight days (#94–#102).** Thirteen open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-12 run: **#102**, today's alarm (created 11:09Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#101** has expired into the pile (superseded by #102). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-12 one: close #94–#101** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #102 (live today) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
93:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-12: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) again shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing since the 2026-09-11 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked per Giulio 2026-09-04 on stable v1.4.0), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review; `8c61268` on `mule/queue`, **not yet on `origin/main`**), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
97:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-12: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 8 straight days (#94–#101).** Twelve open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-11 run: **#101**, today's alarm (created 10:58Z, "nothing has landed in 14h"); **#100** has expired into the pile (superseded by #101). Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so no todo.md task lines. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-11 one: close #94–#100** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #101 (live today) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
99:- **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-11: nothing new proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 7 straight days and worth a look.** Twelve open issues. Still no machine-checkable fix candidates, so no task lines: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on stable v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-10 run: **#100**, today's alarm (created 10:55Z, "nothing has landed in 15h"). #99–#94 are the same `mule-alarm` (one per day 2026-09-05→09-10, ~11:00Z each, zero comments) — telemetry, not code issues, so never proposable. But seven consecutive alarms is past the "low-activity window" wording earlier runs used: the mule has landed no commit since ~2026-09-04/05, and `main`'s queue copy shows the top line as `- [ ]` while the landed work below is all `[!] BLOCKED` (`wrote nothing` / `tests failed`) — though `mule/queue` is the authoritative copy. **Proposal: close #94–#99** — each was a one-day event, superseded by next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #100 (live today) to self-expire. If the idle streak is not intentional, the queue wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.
101:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-11: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-10 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled.

103:- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-10: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Latest release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) confirms upstream still has **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable is `v1.3.3` (2026-08-07), newest pre-release is `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-09 run. `milestone-3.0` label remains empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): of #47–#89 all are closed except the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, gated on a stable v1.4.0), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed commit `8c61268`), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0). Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on upstream **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call — the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per **#90's frozen decision** (2026-08-23, #90 closed with it recorded): the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the 1.4-experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps found, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.
105:- **Extension point: external-bus Intake (NATS JetStream), 2026-09-10.** `internal/broker/intake.go:56-62` carries a `TODO(extension point)` for a second `Intake` implementation backed by a durable external bus (NATS JetStream) for multi-instance deployment or restart survival. The frozen design decision is in `docs/ROADMAP.md §0.1 rule 3 / docs/DESIGN.md §1.4`; the consumer must reproduce per-device ordering, deferred-ack backpressure, and QoS 0 drop semantics. Not tracked by any open issue. Your call: file a milestone issue or park until the roadmap calls for it.
107:- **Extension point: timescaledb_toolkit lttb downsampling, 2026-09-10.** `internal/store/store.go:139-143` carries a `TODO(extension point)` for switching the `Downsample` method from `time_bucket+avg` to the toolkit's `lttb()` when `timescaledb_toolkit` is present — the probe at `store.go:144-150` already records availability in `s.hasToolkit`, but `datastreams.go` always uses the default path. Design reference: `docs/ROADMAP.md §0.1 rule 3 / docs/DESIGN.md §2.5`. Not tracked by any open issue. Your call: file a milestone issue or park.

This is the only govulncheck symbol finding that is not test-harness-only: GO-2026-6355/6354 (x/crypto/ssh deadlocked-channel DoS) and GO-2026-6253 (moby/go-archive tar path traversal) are reachable only through testcontainers in `internal/testutil/pg.go`, i.e. never in the deployed binary. `x/text` keeps API compatibility minor-to-minor and the modules Astrate exercises (`unicode/norm` via pgx, `text/language` via jsonschema) are unchanged, so this is a fix Astrate actually needs — the hygiene recipe's highest-priority category. Not a mule task (go.mod never-touch): your decision to bump ≥v0.39.0 now or fold into the next milestone-boundary sweep. Raw: https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2026-5970. (The 2026-09-04 dep sweep did not list x/text.)

The named reference doc doesn't exist anywhere, but this milestone's ledger is the live issue set (#47–#89), and previous runs have established the state. Let me re-verify today's actual state as the recipe requires.

Everything verified identical to the 2026-09-23 run. The milestone is gated on a stable upstream v1.4.0 (still rc.5), all open items are already escalated, no new gaps. I'll add today's verification entry to `.mule/for-giulio.md` per the recipe (step 4/5 record keeping), and stop there — no issues, no todo.md lines.

+- **Milestone recipe run, 2026-09-24: v3.0 verified unchanged — still gated on upstream, no action.** Release sweep (`gh api repos/astarte-platform/astarte/releases`) still shows **no stable v1.4.0**: newest stable remains `v1.3.4` (2026-09-18, maintenance-only, no wire/API surface change), newest overall remains `v1.4.0-rc.5` (2026-08-20) — nothing shipped since the 2026-09-23 run. `milestone-3.0` label still empty (this milestone's ledger lives under `upstream-parity`): open items are exactly the already-escalated **#92 keyAgreement** (1.4 experimental decision, parked on stable v1.4.0 per Giulio 2026-09-04), **#93** aclhook comment rewrite (mule-review, pushed `8c61268`, its own recipe path), **#78 FDO** (milestone-4.0, already escalated); the #47–#89 rest are all closed. Both UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67 required/encrypted flags, #68 async_operation) still wait on **v1.4 final** for their reconcile-vs-promote call; the 1.3 surface itself is fully delivered. `APICompatVersion` stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision — the bump is v3.0's final-phase item, due once v1.4.0 goes stable and the experimental rows are reconciled. No new gaps, no issues filed, no task lines proposed; deliberately NOT proposing "complete, cut the tag" — the milestone targets 1.3/**1.4** and the 1.4 gate is unresolved. Your call when a stable v1.4.0 ships: answer #92, run the final-phase bump, then cut the v3.0 tag.

 - **github-issues triage run, 2026-09-24: still nothing proposable — the mule-alarm pile is now 17 days (#94–#110).** Twenty-one open issues, same set: **#93** aclhook comment (mule-review, `8c61268` already pushed, its own recipe path), **#92** keyAgreement (parked on a stable upstream v1.4.0 per the waiting-on row), **#78** FDO (milestone-4.0, already escalated), **#1** untouched per standing instruction. New since the 2026-09-20 runs: the alarms **#108** (09-21), **#109** (09-22) and **#110** (today, 09-24 10:54Z, the live one) — a four-day gap on 09-23 not withstanding. Still zero machine-checkable code-fix candidates, so **no .mule/todo.md task lines added**. **Proposal, extending the 2026-09-20 one: close #94–#109** — each was a one-day event, superseded by the next day's alarm, never actionable; leave #110 (live today) to self-expire. The queue has landed nothing since ~2026-09-04/05 — if that idle streak is not intentional, the wedge is on the Pi and a queue review is the fix.

Let me verify the edit landed cleanly at the top of the file.
→ Read .mule/for-giulio.md [limit=20]
Done. The milestones recipe was carried out for the current target (v3.0):

- **Step 1-2:** First non-DONE milestone is v3.0 (v2.0 marked DONE, no un-escalated gaps); scope is decided (not TBD).
- **Step 3 investigation:** Reference doc `.mule/research/upstream-parity-2026-08-22.md` is still absent from `main` and `origin/mule/research` (already escalated 2026-09-04, line 171-175) — but the milestone's ledger (issues #47–#89) is live and intact. Release sweep: no stable v1.4.0 (newest stable `v1.3.4` 09-18, maintenance-only; newest overall `v1.4.0-rc.5`). `milestone-3.0` label empty (ledger lives under `upstream-parity`); open items exactly #92 (keyAgreement, parked on stable v1.4.0), #93 (aclhook comment, `8c61268` pushed, its own recipe path), #78 (FDO, milestone-4.0) — all already escalated. UPSTREAM-EXPERIMENTAL rows (#67, #68) wait on v1.4 final; APICompatVersion stays 1.2.2 per #90's frozen decision.
- **Step 4:** No new machine-checkable gaps (no missing package/wire message/schema field beyond what's already tracked) and no new design decisions — each open item already has its escalation budget. No `gh issue create` run.
- **Step 5/reporting:** Milestone is *not* complete to report — the 1.4 gate is unresolved — so deliberately no "cut the tag" proposal. Recorded the run in `.mule/for-giulio.md` (newest at top). Nothing appended to `.mule/todo.md`.

Done: v3.0 verified unchanged; still gated on upstream, no action — recorded in for-giulio.
Files: .mule/for-giulio.md
Verified: gh issue list (milestone-3.0, upstream-parity, milestone-4.0), gh api releases, git log/ls-tree for the reference doc -> all consistent with 2026-09-23 state
Unsure: nothing (reference-doc absence is a known escalated item, not re-escalated)
Follow-ups: none (no .mule/todo.md lines added, no issues filed)
