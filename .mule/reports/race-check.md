This is a `[legion]` `[readonly]` task: SSH into the Legion Go, run `go test -race ./...`, and report any failures. Let me check if the Legion Go is reachable.

$ ssh -o ConnectTimeout=5 -o BatchMode=yes legion 'echo reachable' 2>&1
reachable

Legion Go is reachable. Running the race check now.
$ ssh -o BatchMode=yes legion 'cd ~/astrate && git fetch -q && git merge --ff-only -q origin/main && go test -race ./...' 2>&1
