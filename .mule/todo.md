# Mule queue

One task per line. `- [ ]` open, `- [x]` done, `- [!]` blocked (the script writes the reason).
The mule runs the topmost open line. Reorder freely; the order is the priority.

If a line needs more detail than fits, write `.mule/tasks/<slug>.md` and keep the line short.

    tools/mule.sh add "<slug>: <outcome>"
    tools/mule.sh loop

A line tagged `[legion]` needs the Legion Go and is skipped automatically while it is asleep;
the queue moves on to the next runnable line rather than stalling behind it.

**`mule/queue` is authoritative for this file.** The mule ticks on the Pi and writes its
progress there, so editing the queue on `main` resurrects completed tasks the moment the two
are merged — which has happened once. Add and reorder tasks on `mule/queue`; let them reach
`main` only when that branch is merged.

A line marked `- [~]` is **parked**: real work, but not tick-sized. The mule only ever
picks up `- [ ]`. Benchmark runs live here because a single tier is 5-20 minutes of ingest
alone -- past the per-task budget -- and because they want someone watching. Run one by hand:

    tools/mule.sh legion bench-push
    ssh legion 'cd ~/astrate/bench && ./scripts/run-tier.sh small astrate -base-url ... -housekeeping-key ...'

## Queue

- [x] bench-tiers: create the tiered benchmark definitions per .mule/recipes/benchmarks.md (first run only — this task builds the harness, it does not run it)
- [~] bench-small-astrate: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh small astrate` against local Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-medium-astrate: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh medium astrate` against local Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-small-astarte: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh small astarte` against local Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-medium-astarte: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh medium astarte` against local Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-big-astrate [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh big astrate` against Legion Go Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [~] bench-giant-astrate [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh giant astrate` against Legion Go Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [~] bench-big-astarte [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh big astarte` against Legion Go Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [~] bench-giant-astarte [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh giant astarte` against Legion Go Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [!] race-check: on the Legion Go, `cd ~/astrate && git fetch -q && git merge --ff-only -q origin/main && go test -race ./...` (~40s). Report any failure to .mule/for-giulio.md with the full race report. This is the only race coverage that exists — the Pi cannot run -race. [legion] — BLOCKED: opencode exited 1
