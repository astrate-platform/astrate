# Mule queue

One task per line. `- [ ]` open, `- [x]` done, `- [!]` blocked (the script writes the reason).
The mule runs the topmost open line. Reorder freely; the order is the priority.

If a line needs more detail than fits, write `.mule/tasks/<slug>.md` and keep the line short.

    tools/mule.sh add "<slug>: <outcome>"
    tools/mule.sh loop

A line tagged `[legion]` needs the Legion Go and is skipped automatically while it is asleep;
the queue moves on to the next runnable line rather than stalling behind it.

A line tagged `[readonly]` is a **standing check**, not a piece of work. It verifies something
and is expected to produce no diff at all — so an empty diff is success, not the `wrote
nothing` failure it would be for any other line. It never gets ticked off, because a gate is
never done. Its output lands in `.mule/reports/<slug>.md` with the sha it ran against, and it
is skipped while that sha is still HEAD: re-checking code that has not moved buys nothing and
spends a call on a free provider.

**`mule/queue` is authoritative for this file.** The mule ticks on the Pi and writes its
progress there, so editing the queue on `main` resurrects completed tasks the moment the two
are merged — which has happened once. Add and reorder tasks on `mule/queue`; let them reach
`main` only when that branch is merged.

A line marked `- [~]` is **parked**: real work, but not tick-sized. The mule only ever
picks up `- [ ]`. Benchmark runs live here because a single tier is 5-20 minutes of ingest
alone -- past the per-task budget -- and because they want someone watching. Run one by hand:

    tools/mule.sh legion bench-push
    ssh legion 'cd ~/astrate/bench && ./scripts/run-tier.sh small astrate -base-url ... -housekeeping-key ...'

## Where tasks come from

You do not have to feed this file by hand. When a tick finds the queue empty it refills it:

1. **Open GitHub issues labelled `mule`** become task lines, one each, slugged `issue-<N>`.
   This is the front door — anyone, including a stronger model with access to the repo, files
   an issue and the mule picks it up on the next tick without touching the Pi. GitHub is the
   approval surface: an issue exists because someone deliberately wrote it. When a task from
   an issue lands, the mule comments the sha on that issue. It never closes it — whether the
   issue is actually resolved is a judgement about intent, and that is not the mule's call.
2. **Otherwise a proposal recipe runs**, rotating through `github-issues`, `astarte-upstream`,
   `code-review`, `docs-sync`, `hygiene`, so it cannot get stuck re-reviewing the same code
   forever. Lines it invents itself are tagged `[auto]` — nobody approved those, and the tag
   is there so you can tell them apart at a glance and cut them.

A refill costs a tick from the daily budget and never runs the work it just proposed: the
proposals sit for one tick, visible on the branch, which is the window you get to cut a bad
one. `MULE_NO_REFILL=1` turns the whole thing off and makes the mule purely obedient again.

## Queue

- [x] bench-tiers: create the tiered benchmark definitions per .mule/recipes/benchmarks.md (first run only — this task builds the harness, it does not run it)
- [~] bench-small-astrate: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh small astrate` against local Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-medium-astrate: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh medium astrate` against local Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-small-astarte: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh small astarte` against local Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-medium-astarte: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh medium astarte` against local Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum) [legion]
- [~] bench-big-astrate [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh big astrate` against Legion Go Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [~] bench-giant-astrate [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh giant astrate` against Legion Go Astrate, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [~] bench-big-astarte [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh big astarte` against Legion Go Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [~] bench-giant-astarte [legion]: run `bench/scripts/run-tier.sh giant astarte` against Legion Go Astarte, commit results (two runs minimum)
- [ ] race-check: on the Legion Go, `cd ~/astrate && git fetch -q && git merge --ff-only -q origin/main && go test -race ./...` (~40s). Report any failure to .mule/for-giulio.md with the full race report. This is the only race coverage that exists — the Pi cannot run -race. [legion] [readonly]
